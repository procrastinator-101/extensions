		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

		<p>Last updated: January 8, 2026</p>

		<p>
			Asura Manager ("we", "our", or "the extension") respects your
			privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy
			explains how your information is handled when using our Chrome
			extension.
		</p>

		<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
		<p>
			Asura Manager does not collect any personal information from users.
			All data is stored locally on your device.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Reading progress, chapter history, and series information are
				saved locally in <code>chrome.storage.local</code>.
			</li>
			<li>
				No usernames, passwords, email addresses, or any personally
				identifiable information are collected or transmitted.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>2. How Data is Used</h2>
		<p>All data stored by the extension is used solely to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Track your reading progress</li>
			<li>Display your progress dashboard within the extension popup</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
		<p>
			We do not share your data with any third parties. All data remains
			on your device and is never sent to external servers.
		</p>

		<h2>4. Clearing Data</h2>
		<p>
			You can clear all saved progress at any time using the "Clear All"
			button in the extension popup. Once cleared, this data cannot be
			recovered.
		</p>

		<h2>5. Security</h2>
		<p>
			Data is stored locally in your browser's storage. While we take
			steps to ensure the extension does not access external sites, your
			device and Chrome browser's security practices also help protect
			this data.
		</p>

		<h2>6. Updates to Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
			We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. The latest version
			will always be included in the extension and updated on the Chrome
			Web Store.
		</p>

		<h2>7. Contact</h2>
		<p>
			If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or how your data is
			handled, you can contact the extension developer via the Chrome Web
			Store listing.
